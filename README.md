TDI data challenge

The TDI folder contains:
- the airbnb listings of SFO as of Dec 2019 in csv format
- the R markdown file
- the HTMl output

The proposed capstone project will improve the data model by combining geographic locations, local weather and local event calendar to enhance its prediction power to help hosts to set dynamic rental prices and predicting occupancy.
